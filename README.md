# IncomePredictor
 This project takes a CSV file called 'income_evaluation.csv'  file as input which contains the details of various people and their salaries.  Our goal is to predict the probability of the income being greater than $50k.

This project is the part of the course named "Machine Learning (CS-596)" at SDSU.
